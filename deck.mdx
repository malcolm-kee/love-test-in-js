# How to Love Writing Test for JavaScript

---

# I hated writing JavaScript tests

---

<ul>
  <Appear>
    <li>it is hard to maintain (add code + bug fix)</li>
    <li>it doesn't catch my bug</li>
    <li>it is boring</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

# If I'm a good developer, my code shouldn't have bug.

But I'm human.

# Test it at "Right" Level of Isolation

# Test is code too

- keep it DRY (but don't overdo it)
- it's all about tradeoff
