# I hated writing JavaScript tests

---

## 1. Hard to maintain (add code + bug fix)

---

## 2. Doesn't catch my bug

---

## 3. Boring

---

# If I'm a good developer, my code shouldn't have bug.

---

But I'm human.

# Test is like security. Too much of it will cause the "safest" result: do nothing.

# Test public API

    The common wisdom is that unit tests make refactoring harder, but for React,
    the opposite has been true. I do huge rewrites several times a year, and I‚Äôm
    only able to do so because our test suite provides so much safety.

    When people say, ‚Äúonly test the public API,‚Äù this is why!

And private API that you feel less confident.

# Test code is code too

- keep it DRY (but don't overdo it)
- it's all tradeoff
