# I hated writing JavaScript tests

---

## 1. Hard to maintain (add code + bug fix)

---

## 2. Doesn't catch my bug

---

## 3. Boring

---

# If I'm a good developer, my code shouldn't have bug.

---

But I'm human.

---

# Test it at "Right" Level of Isolation

(Testing triangle goes here)

# Test is code too

- keep it DRY (but don't overdo it)
- it's all about tradeoff

# Give It a Try
